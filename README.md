## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SASS/SCSS
-   Flexbox
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React framework

### Continued development

I find it beginner friendly to use the create react app although I some people says taht CRA has so much cons I find it great to start with as a beginner. I will continue to learn how to make components and eventually use hooks and other features of react for future projects.

### Useful resources

-   (https://youtu.be/j942wKiXFu8) - I used this youtube playlist from The Net Ninja as a guide on learning React.
-   (https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) - As for deployment on github pages this repo helped me to do it.
